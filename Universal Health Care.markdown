Universal healthcare would bring more socialism to America - taxes would increase and everyone would have to wait longer for worse service.

Studies suggest Obamacare alone will increase the federal deficit by 500-700 billing dollars by 2021.<ref>The Fiscal Consequences of the Affordable Care Act</ref><ref>Five Myths about New Health Care Law</ref>

Access to a waiting list is not access to health care - unlike the US, countries with nationalized insurance have to pass laws to ensure people can see doctors.<ref>What the World Doesn't Know About Health Care in America</ref> Moreover, countries famous for having nationalized health care offer more and more people the opportunity to purchase private insurance.<ref>What the World Doesn't Know About Health Care in America</ref>

While the US spends more on health care than other developed countries, despite having lower life expectancy, "there are large differences in homicides, car accidents, drug overdose deaths, and ... controlling for these alone can bring the US much more inline with N/W Europe" - and that doesn't even include our diet, smoking and activity levels which also have a huge impact.<ref>US Life Expectancy is Below Naive Expectations Mostly Because it Economically Outperforms</ref>

In short, Universal Health Care isn't the magic bullet some say it is.

It would only make our current health care situation worse and more expensive.
