# Arguments in Opposing Change

- [Info](https://github.com/convinceme/info)
- [content guidelines](https://www.convinceme.us/content_instructions)

Good arguments do these things:

- Explain what the change would do
- Explain why the change shouldn't happen
- Use references

The goal is to convince people, not preach to the choir or insult people who believe different things

Pull Requests can only be merged by the GitHub team members in charge of _arguments against_.
