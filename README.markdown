## Conservative responses to [ConvinceMe topics](https://github.com/convinceme/info/blob/master/topics.tsv)

To add a new topic:

- Create a new response by creating a pull request with a file named "Topic Name.markdown" (case sensitive)
- Follow [the content guidelines](https://github.com/convinceme/info/blob/master/content guidelines)

Pull Requests can only be merged by the conservative GitHub team members (they essentially serve as editors). The goal is to create an excellent, clear and concise argument that will win over readers (not insult, or preach to the choir)

If someone suggests something outside of reasonable conservative thought, please recommend they add it to the appropriate "content from" repository (e.g. [content from reactionary](https://github.com/convinceme/content_from_reactionary))
